# Model Optimization

Welcome to the **Model Optimization Module**!  
In this series, we'll explore powerful techniques to make machine learning models more efficient in terms of **memory**, **computation**, and **inference speed** — all while maintaining high accuracy.

Whether you're deploying models to edge devices or scaling inference in production, model optimization is key to performance.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, it’s recommended that you have:

- A basic understanding of **deep learning**, model training, and fine-tuning
- Hands-on experience with **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, or **Hugging Face Transformers**
- Familiarity with concepts like weights, activations, and inference

## Learning Path Overview

This module is divided into several digestible parts:

1. **Introduction to Model Optimization**  
   Why optimization matters — motivation, trade-offs, and applications

2. **Numerical Precision & Data Formats**  
   Understand how numbers are stored and what happens during quantization  
   → FP32, FP16, BF16, INT8, INT4 explained with examples

3. **Optimization During Training**  
   Techniques like pruning, knowledge distillation, and mixed precision training

4. **Post-Training Optimization**  
   Speed-up techniques without retraining — quantization, operator fusion, and weight clustering

5. **Quantization Techniques**  
   Dive into modern methods and formats:

   - **GGUF (GPTQ-compatible binary format)**
   - **AWQ (AutoAWQ for 4-bit INT quantization)**
   - **GPTQ (Quantization for Transformers)**

6. **Serving and Inference Libraries**  
   Popular toolkits and runtimes for fast inference:
   - **NVIDIA TensorRT**, **ONNX Runtime**
   - **vLLM**, **Triton Inference Server**
   - **AutoAWQ**, **Exllama**, **MLC**
