# Neural Network Refresher

Welcome to the Neural Network refresher chapter! Here we'll review the fundamental concepts of neural networks and deep learning.

## What you'll learn

In this chapter, we'll cover:

- Neural Network basics
- Activation functions
- Forward and backward propagation
- Training neural networks
- Common architectures

## Getting Started

Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning. This chapter will refresh your knowledge of neural network concepts and prepare you for more advanced topics.

## Neural Network Basics

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It consists of:

1. **Neurons (Nodes)**
   - Process and transmit information
   - Apply activation functions

2. **Connections (Weights)**
   - Connect neurons
   - Store learned patterns

3. **Layers**
   - Input layer
   - Hidden layers
   - Output layer

## Activation Functions

Common activation functions include:

- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Sigmoid
- Tanh
- Softmax

## Forward Propagation

The process of passing input through the network:

1. Input processing
2. Weight multiplication
3. Bias addition
4. Activation function application

## Backward Propagation

The learning process:

1. Error calculation
2. Gradient computation
3. Weight updates
4. Bias adjustments

## Training Process

Steps in training a neural network:

1. Data preparation
2. Network initialization
3. Forward propagation
4. Error calculation
5. Backward propagation
6. Parameter updates
7. Iteration

## Common Architectures

We'll explore these architectures:

- Feedforward Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformers
